about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm an experienced backend software engineer and manager of small teams with 16 years industry experience in finance and ecommerce. I have worked in a range of roles developing, deploying and supporting mission critical software for leading financial firms and most recently an ecommerce startup. As an engineer, I like thinking from first principles to find practical, elegant solutions that can be implemented with a minimum of fuss. As a manager I lead by example and get my hands dirty. I aim to serve my teams, remove obstacles and give them appropriate responsibility and space to grow. I'm looking for a hands-on technical role that where I can share my enthusiasm for problem solving in an environment of similarly minded people.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Outside of work I'm also a keen amateur skateboardist, a hobby I orginally took up at age of 17 and recently rediscovered in my 40's. I enjoy chess, becoming ever so slightly addicted to playing online during the pandemic and at Drip I ran the chess club and organised tournaments (which I sadly did not win). My wife and I emmigrated to New York from the UK in 2011 and have two children and cat. Some random facts, I used to be a postman (mailman) and have delivered Gillian Anderson's mail and many years ago I was in [this music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gtND3Y69z4).
