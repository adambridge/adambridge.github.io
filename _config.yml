  Hi, my name's Adam and I'm a engineering manager. Well, right now I'm a house husband, father, cat-dad, and skateboarding instructor but I am currenly seeking new a new role in the tech sector. Most recently I spent 2 years with the excellent folks at Drip, an email marketing startup, working on the Platform team mainly focused on infrastructure and core services. Before that I was in consulting and worked on a variety of interesting projects in the financial sector. I like figuring things out, writing code, and finding ways to be useful. I also used to be a postman, as we Brits call our mailmen, and walk around delivering Netflix DVDs by hand (I once had a parcel for Gillian Anderson although sadly she was not at home). I have experience working on web apps in Rails and Java and I've clocked up a fair bit of time nosing around in AWS.

          Drip was an excellent place to work and probably as close as I've come so far to my ideal job. I joined as a Senior Engineer on the Platform team responsible for infrastructure and core services. Later on I became the manager after ours moved up - no-one was keen and I don't like to say no. Sadly after the company's fortunes took a turn for the worse I was let go in a significant round of redundancies. Even so it was without doubt the most valuable experience of my career so far and I hope I get another similar oportunity. Most of my experience of AWS is from this role and I became more closely aquainted with a range of services: EC2, SQS, Cloudwatch, CodeDeploy, Lambda, Kinesis, ECS, RDS, S3, IAM, and DynamoDB, provisioned via Ansible and Terraform. We were responsible for application monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, Vivid Cortex), security, pen-testing (Horizon.ai), and database replication and failover (Postgres on EC2). I even found time to do a bit of feature development in the core Rails application!

          My first proper job after graduation from university. I actually applied to a technician's job but no soldering was pretty hopeless so they put me to work in the laboratory instead.

          After returning from South East Asia where I had been staying with my now wife I did a bit of bar work and got a job with Royal Mail as I had worked for them before as a temp in the seaside retreat of Herne Bay. Being a postie in London was pretty neat though, even if I'm not an early bird by nature, as my route in SW11 had me delivering to Gillian Andserson, Robbie Williams, Sebastian Faulks, and Sienna Miller. Also probably the fittest I've ever been from marching about with a heavy sack every day (oo-er).

          An assortment of part-time and temporary jobs while at school and university, the very first being a delivery boy for United Pharmacy in Canterbury, fond memories of that one. I worked retail in Next (so boring and I expect it showed), and pulled pints at Simple Simon's in Canterbury and the now demolished Falmouth Keogh Halls student union bar. The local recruitment agency provided various interesting assignemts such as assembling parking meters, spot welding filing cabinets, moving things about in warehouses, and chilselling hardened glue from inside a machine that made the slightly fuzzy insides of cars.
